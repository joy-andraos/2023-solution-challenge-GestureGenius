# GestureGenius
GestureGenius is a Tensorflow model that aims to facilitate communication between deaf people who practice the Lebanese Sign Language and other individuals. 

# How does it work?
The first

# Technologies used
- Python : the go-to language for machine learning projects due to its simplicity and extensive libraries
- Teachable Machine :  a user-friendly web application that creates machine learning models from collected data
- Tensorflow: an open-source library for machine learning that enables the creation, training, and deployment of neural network models

# Future Improvements
- Add more words to the data set
- Add the percentage of accuracy of the predictions
- Implement the model in a website or an app for more accessibility
